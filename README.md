# Skylark - a mini-accelerator
Skylark is a WIP project I am starting focused on creating a very simple accelerator chip (in the vein of [tiny-gpu](https://github.com/adam-maj/tiny-gpu))
along with a compiler + language for this chip. Currently fleshing out the design of the chip in Verilog using the [cocotb](https://www.cocotb.org/) framework
for testing. The compiler will most likely be written in C++ or Rust. Stay tuned!


## Naming
As with most of my new projects, it has a punny name. This one is a reference to 
[Chippington Charles Henry Icarus Finneas "Chip" Skylark III](https://fairlyoddparents.fandom.com/wiki/Chip_Skylark). Intel also has,
the Skylake series of CPU that always made me think of Chip Skylark. Thus, the 
name was born.
